MugglePay is a WooCommerce payment gateway for accepting cryptocurrency payments with real-time settlement.

== Description ==

Since its establishment in 2019, MugglePay has over 14,000 registered merchants, many of whom are in the e-commerce sector. However, current integration with MugglePay requires additional development. We aim to streamline this process by launching a Woo payment plugin, also assisting merchants using other website tools to transition to Woo.

== External Services ==

Any of your order payments and refund processes will be serviced through the MugglePay API, with the interface address at https://api.mugglepay.com/v1. You can visit https://github.com/MugglePay/MugglePay for more related content."
